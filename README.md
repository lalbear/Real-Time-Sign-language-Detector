# Real-Time-Sign-language-Detector
This repository contains a Python-based application that detects sign language gestures using a webcam feed. The project utilizes deep learning models, OpenCV for video processing, and TensorFlow for gesture classification. The main objective is to recognize hand gestures in real time and display their corresponding labels.

Features

Real-Time Hand Gesture Detection: Detects hand gestures through a webcam feed.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a TensorFlow-based model to classify gestures.

Dynamic Cropping: Automatically identifies the hand in the webcam feed and adjusts the region of interest.

Interactive Interface: Displays the webcam feed and gesture classification results directly on the screen.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV 4.x

NumPy

cvzone (for hand detection)

How It Works

Webcam Feed:
The application accesses the webcam and displays a live feed.

Hand Detection:

OpenCV and the cvzone.HandTrackingModule detect the hand in the frame.

The bounding box around the hand is dynamically cropped to focus on the hand region.

Gesture Classification:

The cropped hand region is preprocessed and fed into the TensorFlow model.

The model predicts the gesture and displays the corresponding label on the screen.

Feedback Display:

The application overlays the predicted label and bounding box on the webcam feed.

Labels such as "No Hands Detected" are shown when no hand is present in the frame.

Model Information

Model Type: TensorFlow SavedModel format.

Input Size: 300x300 pixels.

Output: Predicted gesture label based on the input image.



Limitations

Works best with a well-lit environment.

May struggle with overlapping hands or multiple hands in the frame.

Accuracy depends on the quality of the training dataset.

Future Enhancements

Add support for additional gestures.

Improve gesture classification accuracy with a larger dataset.

Implement multi-hand detection and classification.

Create a web-based interface for easier deployment.
